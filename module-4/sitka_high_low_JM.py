The original sikta_high.py was modified to extract the lows data from the 'sitka_weather_2018_simple.csv' file,
as well as the original date and high temps. Function was made to allow usersâ€™ inputs to control what data was 
processed through the plot(graph function) based on the user inputs from the main function's inputs.
The main function includes a menu and prompt to have the user input highs, lows, and exit, along with alternatives listed out.
and provides a loop back when the user closes the pop-up, allowing them to input a different option.
